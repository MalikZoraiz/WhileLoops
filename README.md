This repository contains three examples of JavaScript loops embedded within HTML files.

For Loop Example (for-loop-example.html): Demonstrates a for loop that initializes a count at 0 and iterates until the count reaches 9, dynamically updating the content within a <p> element to display each count and concluding with "Loop stopped!".

While Loop Example (while-loop-example.html): Illustrates a while loop that initializes a count at 0 and continues to execute until the count is less than 10, updating the content within a <div> element to display each count and ending with "Loop stopped!".

Do-While Loop Example (do-while-loop-example.html): Shows a do-while loop starting with a count at 0 and executing until the count is less than 5, updating the content within another <div> element to display each count and finishing with "Loop stopped!".
